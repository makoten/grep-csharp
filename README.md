# Build Your Own Grep

## Description
The goal of this hobby project is to imitate a fraction of the power of `grep`.
I created it strictly for learning purposes and is not meant for production.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have dotnet (8.0) installed locally
2. Run ./your_program.sh to run your program, which is implemented in src/Program.cs.
